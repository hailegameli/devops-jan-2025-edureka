WHEN YOU BUILD THIS AND THE IMAGE SIZE IS IN GBÂ´S, USE THE MULTI STAGE BELOW!!!


#Stage1
FROM node:20 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

#stage2
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
# --from=build: Refers to the previous stage labeled build (i.e., FROM node:20 AS build).
# /app: This is the path inside the build stage container where your full app and dependencies are located.
# ./: Refers to the current working directory in the final image, which is /app (from WORKDIR /app).
# So this line effectively transfers the fully prepared application from the build container into the final lightweight production container.
COPY --from=build /app ./
#install only prod dependencies and omit development dependecies
RUN npm install --omit=dev
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

# --from=build: Refers to the previous stage labeled build (i.e., FROM node:18-alpine AS build).
# /app: This is the path inside the build stage container where your full app and dependencies are located.
# ./: Refers to the current working directory in the final image, which is /app (from WORKDIR /app).
# So this line effectively transfers the fully prepared application from the build container into the final lightweight production container.
